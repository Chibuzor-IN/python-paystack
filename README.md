Python API wrapper for paystack

# Installation

pip install python-paystack

# Configuration

PaystackConfig.SECRET_KEY  = PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY
PaystackConfig.PUBLIC_KEY = PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY

``` 

# Usage

Most of the library's functionality lies in the managers.py file which contains the PaymentManager, CustomersManager, PlanManager and the TransactionsManager.

Starting and verifying transactions is handled by the PaymentManager which is designed to handle one transaction with a customer.
When PaymentManager.start_transaction is called, it returns a paystack url which the user is to be redirected to 
After a transaction is confirmed, the details are saved as member variables of the PaymentManager object . 
Charging customers with an existing authorization is handled by the TransactionsManager.

# Payments

**Starting and verifying a transaction**
```python
payment_manager = PaymentManager(20000, 'test@email.com')
payment_manager.start_transaction()
#Starts a transaction and returns a paystack url

#Payments can be verified using their reference
payment_manager.verify_transaction(payment_manager.reference)

``` 

# Customers

**Registering a customer with paystack**

A customer can be registered using the CustomersManager.create_customer method which accepts a Customer object as an argument.
All the customer information to be sent to paystack is taken from the Customer object.
Misc. data can also be sent using the meta argument.
```python
customer = Customer('test@email.com')
customer_manager = CustomersManager()
customer_manager.create_customer(customer)
```

**Getting existing customers**
```python
customer_manager = CustomersManager()
customer_manager.get_customers() #Returns a list containing every customer

customer_manager.get_customer(id) #Returns customer with the specified id
```
